849,,,"He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it,",,,,( door closes )
850,,,but he didn't build the sewers.,,,,You helped us get beyond the Wall.
851,,,"That was beneath him,",,,,"- You're a good man. - Oh, well, thank you,"
852,,,so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find--,,,,"but, um, I'm not sure that I am."
853,,,me.,,,,What happened to you beyond the Wall?
854,,,"He was right, I was low.",,,,I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

861,,,"so in the process of building the sewers,",,,,Um...
862,,,I threw in something for myself.,,,,Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead.
863,,,It was a passage that began,,,,I know he is.
864,,,in an out of the way cove by the sea,,,,"But he can't do it alone,"
865,,,and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.,,,,so I've come here to help him.
866,,,No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.,,,,He's on his way back to Winterfell
867,,,Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.,,,,with Daenerys Targaryen.
868,,,"( grunts, wheezes )",,,,You-- you saw this in--

870,,,"""Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.""",,,,Oh.
871,,,- ( grunting ) - ( all shouting ),,,,He needs to know the truth.
872,,,And so it begins.,,,,The truth about what?
873,,,They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.,,,,About himself.
874,,,They will be outnumbered.,,,,No one knows. No one but me.
875,,,They will have less armor and fewer weapons.,,,,Jon isn't really my father's son.
876,,,But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.,,,,"He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark."
877,,,The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.,,,,He was born in a tower in Dorne.
878,,,They will be fighting for freedom,,,,"His last name isn't really Snow,"
879,,,and the person who gave it to them.,,,,it's Sand.
880,,,They will be fighting for you.,,,,It's not.
881,,,And that is why they will triumph.,,,,Dornish bastards are named Sand.

885,,,Where are they?!,,,,Are you certain?
886,,,Where are the rest of the Lannisters?,,,,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary.
887,,,( men shouting ),,,,I don't know why he'd lie.
888,,,( chatter ),,,,Is this something you can see?
889,,,( door opens ),,,,"Rhaegar and Lyanna: Father, Smith, Warrior,"
890,,,- It's done. - It is.,,,,"Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger."
891,,,And now the rains weep o'er our halls.,,,,- I am hers and she is mine... - I am his and he is mine...
892,,,Did we fight well?,,,,from this day until the end of my days.
893,,,"Uh, as well as could be expected.",,,,Bran's voice: Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie.
894,,,It was never our forte.,,,,Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt or rape her.
895,,,"Golden roses, indeed.",,,,He loved her.
896,,,Your brother and his new queen,,,,And she loved him.

906,,,"Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position",,,,Bran's voice: He needs to know.
907,,,and march all the way across Westeros.,,,,We need to tell him.
908,,,"And you took your army, your real army,",,,,Are you all right?
909,,,and went where they weren't.,,,,It's just strange.
910,,,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.,,,,"In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
911,,,There are always lessons in failures.,,,,You did the right thing.
912,,,Yes. You must be very wise by now.,,,,You did it.
913,,,My father always said I was a slow learner.,,,,I'm just the executioner.
914,,,"If he was so clever,",,,,You passed the sentence.
915,,,why didn't he take Highgarden,,,,You're the Lady of Winterfell.
916,,,the moment your gold mines ran dry?,,,,Does that bother you?
917,,,( scoffs ),,,,I was never going to be as good a lady as you.
918,,,I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.,,,,So I had to be something else.

920,,,How will you do it?,,,,You would have.
921,,,With that sword?,,,,You're the strongest person I know.
922,,,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?",,,,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
923,,,Not that he ever used it.,,,,"Well, don't get used to it."
924,,,What did he call it?,,,,You're still very strange and annoying.
925,,,Widow's Wail.,,,,"""In winter, we must protect ourselves."
926,,,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he?",,,,"Look after one another."""
927,,,I did unspeakable things to protect my family.,,,,Father.

933,,,But your sister has done things...,,,,( birds cawing )
934,,,I was incapable of imagining.,,,,( chatter )
935,,,That was my prize mistake--,,,,Beric: It's a long way down.
936,,,a failure of imagination.,,,,Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
937,,,"She's a monster, you do know that?",,,,Man: I can see movement...
